Slides and notes from StormTalks @ UBC #006

You'll most likely want to use `HD w notes`; full-res screenshots (so you can actually read the AppDelegate code). Unfortunately, I don't like having a script for a presentation, so the notes are a little sparse. Feel free to contact me on Twitter: @alexpopovjr or via email (first slide) if you have any questions.
